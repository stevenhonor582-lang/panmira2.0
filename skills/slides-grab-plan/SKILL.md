# slides-grab Plan Skill (Codex)

Use this when the user asks to start a new presentation from scratch.

## Goal
Produce an approved `slide-outline.md` before any slide HTML generation.

## Inputs
- Topic and intent
- Audience
- Tone and constraints
- Optional research findings

## Output
- `slide-outline.md` (must include `style: <id>` in meta section)

## Workflow
1. Analyze user goal and audience.
2. **Style selection (mandatory, before outline):** Three paths are accepted, in priority order:
   a. **Bundled style** — run `slides-grab list-styles`, shortlist 2–3 styles, and get explicit user approval. Optionally offer `slides-grab preview-styles` for visual preview. Record as `style: <id>`.
   b. **Custom DESIGN.md path** — if a local `DESIGN.md` exists (e.g. provided directly or fetched via `slides-grab import-design <https-url>`), inspect it with `slides-grab show-design ./DESIGN.md` and confirm with the user.
   c. **Free-form custom direction** — if neither bundled nor DESIGN.md fits, propose a written custom direction and get approval.
3. **DESIGN.md → DESIGN.slides.md conversion (mandatory when path 2b was chosen):**
   - A `DESIGN.md` imported from `voltagent/awesome-design-md` or similar sources describes a **marketing website** (top-nav, hero-band, CTA buttons, pricing cards, footer-band). Slides are **single 720pt × 405pt frames** with no scroll, no nav, no clicks — copying web components into slides produces deck pages that look like landing pages.
   - Read `references/design-md-to-slides-conversion.md` for the canonical conversion guide.
   - Translate the imported `./DESIGN.md` into a sibling `./DESIGN.slides.md` next to it. Leave the original `DESIGN.md` untouched. The `DESIGN.slides.md` MUST follow the Output Contract in the reference and apply every row of the web → slide mapping table (top-nav → eyebrow strip, hero-band → cover layout, CTA buttons → kicker text, footer-band → thin footer strip, pricing grids → dropped, etc.).
   - Present a 5–10 line summary of the conversion to the user (kept tokens + dropped web sections + new slide layouts inferred) and wait for explicit approval before continuing.
   - After approval, run `slides-grab show-design ./DESIGN.slides.md` to confirm the parser reads it cleanly.
4. Create or revise `slide-outline.md` with ordered slides and key messages. Record the approved style reference in the meta section:
   - bundled style → `style: <id>`
   - converted DESIGN.slides.md → `style: ./DESIGN.slides.md`
   - free-form custom direction → leave a one-paragraph `style:` block describing it
5. Present a concise summary to user.
6. Repeat revisions until explicit approval.

## Rules
- **Do not write the outline before the user approves a style.** Style selection comes first.
- Do not generate slide HTML (`<slides-dir>/slide-*.html`) in this stage.
- Keep scope to structure, narrative, and style selection.
- Ask for approval before moving to design.
- Assume later stages run through the packaged `slides-grab` CLI.
- Use the packaged CLI and bundled references only; do not depend on unpublished agent-specific files.

## Reference
If needed, use the bundled outline reference:
- `references/outline-format.md`
- `references/plan-workflow-reference.md` — archived detailed planning workflow and organizer-agent guidance
- `references/design-md-to-slides-conversion.md` — DESIGN.md (web) → DESIGN.slides.md (slide) translation guide, including the structured output template and the web → slide mapping table
